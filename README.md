# Shrimp
An unconventional, multiplatform RPN calculator

## Why RPN?
Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is one out of many possible ways to enter numbers and operators in a calculator. It was common in the early "advanced" calculators (such as many HP models of the 70s) and is also called *postfix notation*. To make a comparison, most of current operations are encoded with the *infix notation*, in which the operator is between the operands. In RPN, the operands come first, and the operator last. Despite the (now) seemingly excessive complexity, RPN brings several advantages:
* No need for parentheses
* Easy expression management with stack logic
* Less keystrokes
* **Adherence to the mental way in which we compute expressions in our brain**

## Why Shrimp?
As an engineer, I use calculators *a lot*, hence I appreciate RPN for the way in which computation is made more efficient for the user, more than the machine. Especially, the last point mentioned above is what I like most. I've been looking for RPN calculators for a long time, and even if there are many of them which work really well, they mostly try to replicate operation and appearance of old RPN calculators and are merely graphical. This is a serious flaw when speed is the foremost concern.
So I tried to develop a new one! And here is Shrimp!
